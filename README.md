# Cinema-Page
A small project I did of a cinema website in which you can Log in, sign up and make a reservation for a movie

You need to have XAAMP installed in order for the website to work.
Take the file and put it in the xaamp/htdocs
Open XAAMP, start Apache server and MYSQL
visit the site from localhost/"nameof the folder you put your files"/index.php


the project is not yet finished, there will be updates soon
